# Biology

Knowledge in biology is represented in different ways. Some are very general, like the concept of `hemoglobin`,
while others are very specific, like the `chemical graph of caffeine`. Databases generally have one level of
detail as the principle model of the biology it represents. And different databases may link to each other
but actually have a different model.
